Hello world, 

I am Masum, a web developer from a beautiful piece of the world, Bangladesh. This is my first blog post on my personal blog. 

I will start by thanking all the awesome people who shares their knowledge via internet. They are the real heroes, and because of them I could learn what I do today to support my loved ones.

### The evils of indecision !
I have been thinking to start my personal blog/website for too long. But what kept me from doing that ? well you guessed right, I though I don't know enough to share anything. May be I should learn a little more, so I can share valuable content. and once you choose to be ready before you share, well you never get ready enough and you share nothing.

But now it must change. I am not claiming to be an expert but I can share my naive findings, may be some dumb experiences. I hope someone finds these helpful.

So the journey begins...
