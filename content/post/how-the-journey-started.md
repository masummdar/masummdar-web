My journey with computers and specially web started since late 2009. I was a first year student of Environmental Science at Khulna University and was dreaming about all the great research I will do that will help the planet we all call home. I will invest all my energy into studies and someday I get to be an Environmental Scientist :)

But as always life has it's mysteries. I was at home for my summer vacation and my father had a stroke. He was hospitalized for almost a month and lost most of his memories. He couldn't remember any of us and we had to introduce ourselves to him once again.

I am the elder son of the family and there's no way I could leave them here and concentrate in my studies, ~400 miles away.

With my father in bed, we for the first time realized how vulnerable we were financially. He is the sole earner of the family and none of us knew nothing about earning a living. This was the first time I realized, just being a good student wasn't enough. I have to earn.

We had a shop and my younger brother started looking after it, also leaving his studies. And now I must find something to do for a living.

I have a friend who was at an engineering colledge and from him I first learned about outsourcing and web development. How students worked on nights doing web and software development projects from internet.

So, I took a loan, moved to city and bought my first computer.
